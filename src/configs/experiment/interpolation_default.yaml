# Main experiment config with default loss
defaults:
  - model: fno3d_interpolation
  - loss: mse  # Default to basic MSE loss
  - _self_

# Your other experiment settings...
experiment_name: "interpolation_experiment"
seed: 42

# This way if someone runs:
# python train.py
# They get MSE loss by default

# But they can override with:
# python train.py loss=soma_angular
